# Hi, I'm Sarah Mak! 🔥

I'm a writer and narrative designer from Singapore.

I make story-rich video games, interactive fiction, and poetry—and lots of automation scripts.

## What I Do

- 🎮 **Game writing & narrative design** — currently working on several video game projects
- 📝 **Interactive fiction** — my game [*You Can't Save Her*](https://plasmak.itch.io/you-cant-save-her) won awards at the 2024 [Short Games Showcase](https://itch.io/jam/short-games-showcase-2024)
- ✍️ **Poetry** — published in QLRS and Eunoia Review; member of [zer0sleep](https://www.singlitstation.com/) writing collective
- 🕹️ **Game jams** — I design and write little frankenbabies with cool people
- 🤖 **Automation scripts** — I also code lots of little scripts in Python and AutoHotkey—and I'm making some OpenClaw skills too (like [faster-whisper](https://github.com/ThePlasmak/faster-whisper))
